# Genotype_Subtyping
Genotype Subtyping Approach to Identify Unnoticed Variants in Diseases from GWAS data
We propose a method referred to as ‘Genotype Subtyping’ that is based on a classical GWAS to identify seed SNPs; each SNP stratifies cases and controls by its genotype, followed by a sub-GWAS per genotype while keeping the additional number of statistical tests low.
